      <h1>Potato stuffed</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Stuffed potatoes are very popular in Colombia. We eat them for breakfast or as a snack. Papas Rellenas can
        be served hot or cold and are delicious with chili. <br><br>

        Colombians have different versions of Papas Rellenas and each family has their own recipe, I called my aunt
        in Florida to get my grandmother's recipe to make these potatoes. Some people add boiled egg and rice to the
        filling but we don't do it.</p>
