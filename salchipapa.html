        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>To start preparing this delicious salchipapas recipe, wash the potatoes very well, peel them and cut them into strips.</li>
          <li>Put the cut potatoes in a bowl with water, lemon juice and salt to taste. Let them stand for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>After this time, drain and dry the potatoes very well with a paper towel or absorbent cloth.</li>
          <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>When the oil is very hot, fry the potatoes for 5 to 8 minutes or until they begin to brown. Remove and drain on a paper towel.</li>
          <li>Now it's time for the sausages. Cut all the sausages into pieces of any size you like. This time, we have opted for a cross cut at the ends to give them a fun look.</li>
          <li>Toss the sausages in the same oil in which you fried the potatoes. Once they have colored, remove and drain.</li>
          <li>Place the fries on a large platter or plate. Then place the sausages on top.</li>
          <li>Cut the lettuce leaves into strips. </li>
          <li>Finally add the lettuce strips, the chongo potato, the pineapple sauce, the mayonnaise and the pink sauce.</li>
          <li>Add the grated cheese, again the salsa and the baby corn and that's it, enjoy!</li>
