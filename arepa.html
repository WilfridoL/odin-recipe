        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The first step to make our egg arepas is to pre-list the ingredients of the recipe.</li>
          <li>To make the base dough for the arepas we take the corn flour for arepas to a bowl.</li>
          <li>Take the necessary water, according to the directions on the flour package, to a pot and heat together with the margarine until the margarine melts. Mix well.</li>
          <li>Pour the hot water over the flour and let stand for about 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Knead with your hands until the dough has a firm consistency and make medium sized balls as shown in the picture.</li>
          <li>Flatten the balls forming the arepas, you can do it with your hands or help yourself with a plate. The idea is that they have the shape as shown in the picture.</li>
          <li>Take a deep pot to medium heat and add the liter of sunflower oil. We must keep in mind that we must add each arepa alone and when the oil is very hot, this will cause our arepa to inflate during cooking and we must remove it from the oil.</li>
          <li>Apart, very carefully add the egg in a bowl making sure that the yolk does not break.</li>
          <li>Very carefully and without burning, make an opening in the side of the fried arepa. We introduce the egg and close with a little more dough. Then we put the arepa back in the pan with oil to finish frying and cook the egg.</li>
          <li>Remove from the fire our Colombian egg arepas and remove the excess oil with absorbent paper. Serve the arepas for breakfast and accompany with some cheese and an amaranth and papaya smoothie to start the day with energy. Enjoy!</li>
